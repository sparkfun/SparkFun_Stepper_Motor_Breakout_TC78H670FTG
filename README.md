The SparkFun Mini Stepper Motor Driver makes it easy to start developing with the TC78H670FTG bipolar stepper motor driver from Toshiba! With its compact size *(0.6" Ã— 0.8")* and 0.1" pin spacing, the Mini Stepper Motor Driver is perfect for small projects or prototyping on breadboards. Use our extensive [Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_ProDriver_TC78H670FTG_Arduino_Library) with 10 examples, and you can quickly explore the many features of this precise and small package size motor driver IC.

With a high resolution motor control, down to 1/128th of a step, the Mini Stepper Motor Driver can be operated through traditional clock-in stepping or serial commands. Both methods are demonstrated in our Arduino Library. The serial command method is especially unique in that it allows the user to precisely control the phase, torque, current limit and mixed decay ratio of each coil immediately during stepping. Most stepper motor driver ICs require the use of an external trimpot to set the current limit, but with the Mini Stepper Motor Driver, you can precisely adjust it in software, via serial commands!
